# What is HTTP

    - Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application layer protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information systems. HTTP is the foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web, where hypertext documents include hyperlinks to other resources that the user can easily access.

# HTTP is used for communication between the client and the server

    - Now, what does it mean by client and the web server? Suppose you have a browser and you type something in the URL and you press the enter button. Then a request goes to a particular server. The server is called a web server. Whatever data you are sending from this browser to the server is called a request, and whatever data we are getting from this server to the browser, this is called a response. And this is how the browser and web server communicate with each other in the form of request and response. This type of communication is possible only by using the HTTP protocol.
