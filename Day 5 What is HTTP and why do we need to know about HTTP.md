# What is HTTP

Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application layer protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information systems. HTTP is the foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web, where hypertext documents include hyperlinks to other resources that the user can easily access.

## HTTP is used for communication between the client and the server

When you interact with a website using a browser, such as typing a URL into the address bar and pressing enter, a communication process begins between your browser (the client) and a remote computer hosting the website (the web server). Here's how it works:

1. **Client**: The client refers to the software (typically a web browser) that initiates communication by sending a request for a particular resource (such as a webpage, image, or video) to the server.

2. **Web Server**: The web server is a computer that hosts the website and responds to requests from clients. It receives the request sent by the client, processes it, and sends back the requested resource as a response.

3. **Request**: When you type a URL into your browser and hit enter, your browser creates an HTTP request containing information about the resource you want to access (such as the URL, headers, and any additional data). This request is then sent to the web server.

4. **Response**: Upon receiving the request, the web server processes it and generates an HTTP response containing the requested resource (such as an HTML page, image file, or other data). This response is then sent back to the client, where it is rendered by the browser for you to view and interact with.

This exchange of requests and responses between the client and the web server forms the basis of communication on the World Wide Web, facilitated by the HTTP protocol.
