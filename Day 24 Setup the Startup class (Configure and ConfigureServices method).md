# Startup Class

The `Startup` class in a typical ASP.NET Core application is essential for configuring the application's services and request processing pipeline. It contains two primary methods:

- **ConfigureServices**: This method is used to define the services that the application will use. It takes an `IServiceCollection` parameter, allowing registration of application services such as database contexts, authentication, MVC, and other middleware dependencies.

- **Configure**: This method is responsible for configuring the HTTP request pipeline. It takes an `IApplicationBuilder` for configuring the middleware pipeline and an `IWebHostEnvironment` parameter for determining the hosting environment (development, staging, production). In this method, middleware components like routing, authentication, error handling, and static files are configured.

Example code snippet:

```csharp
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting;
using Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection;

namespace ConsoleToWebAPI
{
    public class Startup
    {
        public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
        {

        }
        public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IWebHostEnvironment env)
        {

        }
    }
}
```
