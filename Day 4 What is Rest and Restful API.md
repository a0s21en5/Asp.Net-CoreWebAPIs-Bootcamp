# Rest and Restful API

- **REST** stands for *REpresentation State Transfer*.

REST is a combination of a couple of principles or a set of principles that must be followed by a Web API project in order to say it's RESTful.

These are common standard guidelines that need to be followed by the Web API project:

- URL structure
- HTTP verbs
- Status codes
- Stateless, etc.
