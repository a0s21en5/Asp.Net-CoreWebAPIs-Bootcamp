# Working with Entity Framework Core

## What is Entity Framework Core

- Entity Framework Core is an open-source framework from Microsoft that works as a bridge between the application and the database.
- It is compatible with any .NET application and any RDBMS.
- Entity Framework Core is Microsoft's official technology for interacting with RDBMS.

## How Entity Framework Core Works

- Entity Framework Core is an Object-Relational Mapper (O/RM) and works from an object-oriented perspective.
- This means all the tables in the database are converted into C# classes, and the corresponding columns are converted into properties of the classes.
