# Status Code

Status codes are issued by the server to provide information about the responses.

All HTTP response status codes are divided into five (5) categories:

- **1xx** - Information response: Indicates an interim response for communicating connection status or request progress before completing the requested action.
- **2xx** - Successful: Indicates that the request was received, understood, and accepted successfully.
- **3xx** - Redirection: Indicates that further action needs to be taken to complete the request, often involving a redirect to a different resource.
- **4xx** - Client error: Indicates that the client has made an error in the request, such as requesting a resource that doesn't exist or lacks proper authentication.
- **5xx** - Server error: Indicates that the server encountered an error or is incapable of performing the request due to unexpected conditions.
