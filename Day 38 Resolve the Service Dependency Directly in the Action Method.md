# Resolve the Service Dependency Directly in the Action Method

In ASP.NET Core, you can inject services into your controllers through constructor injection. However, there are cases where you may want to resolve a service directly within an action method. This can be done by using the `IServiceProvider` within the action method itself.

This tutorial will guide you on how to resolve dependencies directly in the action method.

## Prerequisites

1. ASP.NET Core 5.0 or higher.
2. Basic understanding of Dependency Injection in ASP.NET Core.
3. Visual Studio or any code editor of your choice.

## Step 1: Setting Up the Web API Project

1. Create a new ASP.NET Core Web API project.

   ```bash
   dotnet new webapi -n DependencyInjectionDemo
   cd DependencyInjectionDemo
   ```

2. Open the project in your preferred editor (e.g., Visual Studio or VSCode).

## Step 2: Creating a Service

In this example, we'll create a simple service interface and its implementation.

### 2.1. Define an Interface

Create a folder named `Services` and add a new interface `IMyService.cs`.

```csharp
namespace DependencyInjectionDemo.Services
{
    public interface IMyService
    {
        string GetMessage();
    }
}
```

### 2.2. Implement the Service

Add a class `MyService.cs` that implements the `IMyService` interface.

```csharp
namespace DependencyInjectionDemo.Services
{
    public class MyService : IMyService
    {
        public string GetMessage()
        {
            return "Hello from MyService!";
        }
    }
}
```

### 2.3. Register the Service in Startup

In the `Startup.cs` (or `Program.cs` for .NET 5.0 onwards), register the service in the `ConfigureServices` method.

```csharp
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    services.AddControllers();
    services.AddScoped<IMyService, MyService>();
}
```

## Step 3: Resolving the Service in the Action Method

Instead of injecting the service into the controller’s constructor, you can resolve it directly in the action method.

### 3.1. Modify the Controller

Open the `WeatherForecastController.cs` and modify it to resolve the `IMyService` directly inside an action method.

```csharp
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
using DependencyInjectionDemo.Services;

namespace DependencyInjectionDemo.Controllers
{
    [ApiController]
    [Route("api/[controller]")]
    public class WeatherForecastController : ControllerBase
    {
        private readonly IServiceProvider _serviceProvider;

        public WeatherForecastController(IServiceProvider serviceProvider)
        {
            _serviceProvider = serviceProvider;
        }

        [HttpGet("message")]
        public IActionResult GetMessage()
        {
            var myService = _serviceProvider.GetService<IMyService>();
            if (myService == null)
            {
                return NotFound("Service not found");
            }
            return Ok(myService.GetMessage());
        }
    }
}
```

### 3.2. Explanation

- We are using the `IServiceProvider` to resolve the `IMyService` inside the `GetMessage` action method.
- This method does not use constructor injection, instead it retrieves the required service using `GetService<T>()`.
- `GetService<T>()` will return `null` if the service is not registered, so make sure to handle such cases appropriately.

## Step 4: Run the Application

1. Press `Ctrl + F5` to run the application or use the following command:

   ```bash
   dotnet run
   ```

2. Navigate to `http://localhost:5000/api/weatherforecast/message` in your browser or use Postman/cURL to see the response.

   You should see the following response:

   ```json
   "Hello from MyService!"
   ```

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, you have learned how to resolve service dependencies directly within an action method in ASP.NET Core 5.0 Web API. While constructor injection is more commonly used, this method may be useful in scenarios where you want to resolve services dynamically within specific actions. However, it’s recommended to use constructor injection in most cases, as it leads to better testability and clarity in your code.
