# Middleware

Middleware in ASP.NET Core refers to components that are used to handle requests and responses in the application's HTTP pipeline. Each middleware component is designed to process an incoming HTTP request, optionally perform some processing, and pass the request to the next middleware component in the pipeline. Similarly, middleware can also intercept the outgoing response and perform actions before sending it back to the client.

Middleware components in an ASP.NET Core application can handle various tasks such as routing, authentication, error handling, logging, and more. The order in which middleware components are registered in the application's configuration (`Startup.cs`) determines the order in which they are executed. This order is crucial as it dictates how requests are processed and responses are generated.

## HTTP Request Pipeline

The HTTP request pipeline in ASP.NET Core defines the sequence of middleware components through which every incoming request passes. Each middleware component can modify the request or response, log information, enforce security policies, or handle exceptions before passing the request further down the pipeline.

## Examples of Middleware

- **Routing**: Determines which endpoint should handle an incoming request based on the request URL.
- **Authentication**: Authenticates the user making the request using configured authentication schemes (e.g., cookies, tokens).
- **Exception Handling**: Catches unhandled exceptions that occur during request processing and provides an appropriate error response.
- **Logging**: Records information about requests, responses, and application events for troubleshooting and monitoring purposes.

Middleware components can be built-in ASP.NET Core, provided by third-party libraries, or custom-developed to suit specific application requirements.
